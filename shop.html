What You Will Learn: Gain a solid architectural understanding of the MVC Pattern Learn how to create rich and dynamic web app clients using Angular Learn how to use the ng tools to create and build an Angular project Learn how to extend and customize Angular Learn how to unit test your Angular projects Each topic is covered clearly and concisely and is packed with the details you need to learn to be truly effective. The most important features are given a no-nonsense in-depth treatment and chapters include common problems and details of how to avoid them. Who This Book Is For:This book is for web developers with a foundation knowledge of HTML and JavaScript who want to create rich client-side applications</p>

You will start with learning about the Angular 2 Components architecture and how components differ from Angular directives in Angular 1. You will then move on to quickly set up an Angular 2 development environment and grasp the basics of TypeScript. With this strong foundation in place, you will start building components. The book will teach you, with an example, how to define component behavior, create component templates, and use the controller of your component. You will also learn how to make your components communicate with each other. Once you have built a component, you will learn how to extend it by integrating third-party components with it. By the end of the book, you will be confident with building and using components for your applications. Style and approach A step-by-step guide covering features and working of Angular 2 Components along with the process for creating your own components.</p>
